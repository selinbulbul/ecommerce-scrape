a brief statistics / overview about the data:
•	Top 3 selling products in each product segment by customer rating.
•	Are they the most reviewed products as well?
•	How do you choose to take a decision while buying a product? Only ratings or you consider also how many people has reviewed?
•	So, based on both of these, can you suggest me top 3 products in each product segment.

Suggestions top 3 products in each product segment
•	What are the average ratings for each product type. Can you think of any reasons why some product types have better rating than others? (if any)
•	Can you try to do the same for median ratings?
